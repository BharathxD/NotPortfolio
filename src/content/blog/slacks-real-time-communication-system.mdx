- Messages
- Checkpoints (Membership)
- Realtime Communication

### Database Schema [LLD]

---

| Users |
| ----- |
| id    |
| name  |

| Membership   |
| ------------ |
| user_id      |
| channel_id   |
| [Checkpoint] |
| muted        |
| read_till    |

| Channels       |
| -------------- |
| id             |
| user_id        |
| org            |
| name           |
| type: group_id |

| Messages   |
| ---------- |
| from       |
| channel_id |
| created_at |
| message    |

<aside>
💡 Always create a separate table just like `subscription`, you can also add fields like checkpoint, muted, read_till. Also make sure that it should be a `noun`

</aside>

### WebSockets

---

Each user will maintain a single WebSocket connection with our backend infrastructure, which will handle all `real-time` interactions.

**Edge Servers**

Because WebSocket are `expensive` and browsers have a **6 Concurrent TCP** connection limit, we have to multiplex all realtime communication on `ONE WEBSOCKET` connection

Hence, we need a fleet of servers (Edge Servers) to whom our end users connect over WebSocket [WS]

<aside>
💡 If any service, such as chat or notifications, needs to engage with users in real-time, the data will be routed through these edge servers. Avoid creating multiple WebSocket connections, as this could potentially slow down the system.
