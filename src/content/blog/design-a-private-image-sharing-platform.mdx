In this design system, we will explore the intricacies of a secure image-sharing platform. We'll cover various important aspects, such as how images are delivered on the platform, incorporating Gravatar, improving query performance, setting up an API server, utilizing a content delivery network, and adding tags to photos. The design system also sheds light on the platform's database structure, placing emphasis on security considerations and the overall system architecture.

### Agenda

---

- Designing Gravatar
- On-demand Image optimisation
- Tagging photos
- Designing newly unread message indicator

### How Images are served

---

![Demonstration of URL parts](https://bharath-lakshman-kumar.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Design+a+Image+Sharing+Platform/url.png)

Once the request hits the server

- Reads the URL
- Reads the file from the server at the path (Reads the file from S3)
- Sends the response

![Image tag with url](https://bharath-lakshman-kumar.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Design+a+Image+Sharing+Platform/img-tag.png)

```tsx
app.get("/raw/:path", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const path = req.params.path;
    const raw_bytes = await s3.read(path, process.env.BUCKET);
    res.send(raw_bytes);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Internal Server Error");
  }
});
```

### Let’s build Gravatar

---

**What is gravatar?**

Gravatar is your single embeddable URL for profile picture

`https://gravatar.com/{hash(email)}` → Security (Protecting Personally Identifiable Information)

```tsx
if hash("bharath@example.com") = 'Ti09j98j'
```

```html
<img src="https://gravatar.com/Ti09j98j" />
```

This URL will display your current profile picture.

### Requirements

---

- Users can upload multiple pictures.
- Users can designate one as active.
- The active picture should be returned as part of the response.

### Query Optimization

---

The following SQL query is highly inefficient and costly. The WHERE clause requires computation and cannot take advantage of indexes.

```sql
SELECT * FROM photos
JOIN users
ON photos.user_id = user.id
WHERE HASH(email) = ?
```

So, what's the more efficient query?

```sql
SELECT * FROM photos
JOIN users
ON photos.user_id = user.id
WHERE users.hash = ?
```

### Updating the photo to mark it active

---

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE photos
SET is_active = false
WHERE is_active = true
AND user_id = ?;

UPDATE photos
SET is_active = true
WHERE user_id = ?
AND id = ?
AND is_active = false;

UPDATE users
SET active_photo_id = ....
WHERE user_id = ?;

COMMIT;
```

### Getting the active photo

---

```sql
SELECT * FROM photos
JOIN users
ON photos.user_id = users.id
WHERE users.hash = ?
AND photos.is_active = true
```

**How can we make the above query much better? (As this query is frequently used)**

Add a column named `active_photo_id`

**But then we need to update the other queries?** `YES`

```sql
--- To set the active photo
UPDATE user SET active_photo_id = ? WHERE id = ?
--- To get the active photo
SELECT * FROM photos
WHERE id = (
  SELECT active_photo_id
  FROM users WHERE id = ?
);
```

### Let’s get going by creating an API Server

---

![Uploading a photo api.gravatar.com](https://bharath-lakshman-kumar.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Design+a+Image+Sharing+Platform/api-server.png)

Uploading a photo api.gravatar.com

**Prepare for upload**

---

`S3://gravatar/{user_id}/{random_photo_id}`

- User requests photo upload service for a new upload
- Photo upload service generates a random id
- Photo upload service generates signed
- Photo upload service sends signed URL to user

**Upload Photo**

---

User uploads photo to S3 using pre-signed urls (Learn in-depth about it [here](https://github.com/BharathxD/System-Design/tree/master/Real%20World%20Systems/Design%20a%20Social%20Media%20Network))

**Render the active photo**

---

To render the active photo for a user, follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve the Photo Information**

   First, you need to obtain the necessary information for rendering the active photo. Here's how to do it:

   - Get the `{hash}` from the URL.
   - Retrieve the active photo's ID from the database using SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM photos
   JOIN users ON users.hash = {hash}
   WHERE is_active = true;
   ```

- Retrieve the Photo File

  Once you have the active photo's ID, you can fetch the actual photo file from an S3 bucket. Use the following S3 path to access the image:

  ```txt
  S3://gravatar-images/{user-id}/{photo_id}
  ```

- Render the Active Photo

  Now that you have the image file, you can render it in your HTML or Markdown content using the following `<img>` tag:

  ```html
  <img src="https://api.gravatar.com/photos/{hash}" alt="Active Photo" />
  ```

## Using a CDN to Serve Content

---

When it comes to serving content efficiently, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) can play a crucial role. In this example, we'll configure a CDN for `gravatar.com` to optimize the delivery of images from our API server at `api.gravatar.com/photos`.

**Step 1: Configure the CDN**

To set up the CDN, follow these steps:

1. Configure a CDN with the origin `gravatar.com`, which will point to our actual API server at `api.gravatar.com/photos`.

**Step 2: Handling Cache Miss**

In some cases, the CDN may experience a cache miss, meaning it doesn't have the requested content in its cache. In such situations, you can redirect the request to the API server to retrieve the content dynamically. Here's how:

2. When a cache miss occurs, redirect the request from `https://gravatar.com/hash` to `https://api.gravatar.com/photos/hash`.

### Overall architecture for Gravatar

## Tags in photos

---

### Brainstorm

---

- Who can tag (Authorization) (`Soon`)
- Maximum limit of people tag in a photo (`Soon`)
- Notification & Throttling (`Soon`)
- Self-removal (`Soon`)
- Face-recognition & suggestion (SLA) (`Soon`)
- Profile Activity (DB) (`Soon`)

### Relative Positioning

---

Location = $(320.720, 120/720)$

This allows us to handle multiple on-demand transformations, it is really necessary to store relative position of the bounding box (or) co-ordinates, as the size of the picture may differ on different devices (It will be a efficient so long as the aspect ratio of the image doesn’t change)

Bounding Box = $LTRB/x,y,w,h$

$L$ = Left

$T$ = Top

$R$ = Right

$L$ = Bottom
